# CS 262 Lab06
This lab is based on https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/06hci/lab.html

## Answers to the lab questions:
A) What do the hooks in this code do?
* The hooks in this code allows for us to use state (useEffect and useState) and other React features without writing a class, and in this case allows us to access external information from the api using fetch.

B) Modify the URL to some invalid value and explain how the code responds
* When the URL is changed to some invalid value, the code responds by showing that there is no information to be fetched and displays nothing becuase the URL would be invalid.
